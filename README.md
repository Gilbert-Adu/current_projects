projects I am currently working on

1. Real-time (or near) Marketing tool (uses AI to determine purchase intent of social media posts and alerts business owners when a user is looking for their services. Started Oct 2024. ~80% complete.
2. Webcam health check-up using computer vision - pipe dream and can currently only determine heart beat rate. Willing to add more features as it could be a possible substitute or supplement for who can't afford regular medical checkups. Won't in any way be a "qualified medical personnel" but willing to research more via experts. Started Jan 2025. 
   
3. Autonomous lawn mower - pipe dream project using LiDar, GPS, and Ultrasonic sensors. Progress in research. No implementation yet.

Will add more as it comes
